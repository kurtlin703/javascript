   /** summary
    * every JS object has a prototype property, which makes inheritance posssible in js
    * the prototype propery of an object is where we put methods and properties that we want other objects to inherit
    * the constructor prototype is not the prototype of the constructor itself, its the prototype of all instances that are created through it
